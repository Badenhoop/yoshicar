- start building the app only when everything else works (since all the nasty networking stuff is nothing new to learn)
- figure out how to send ros messages from laptop to raspberry pi
- avoid using rosjava/android-core since repo seems to be extremely unmaintained and depricated
- channels of communication:
    - mode selection (manual vs autonomous navigation) (service)
    - manual steering commands (datagram)
    - navigation commands (datagram)
    - occupancy grid (periodical service, can have slow update rate)
- server side implementation: NetworkingLib
